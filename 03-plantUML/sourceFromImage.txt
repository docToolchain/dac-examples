== How to get the plantUML source from a generated image

PlantUML stores by default the source for a diagram in the meta data of the generated `.png` or `.svg` file.

This can easily be retrieved through the command line:

    java -jar plantuml.jar -metadata whitebox-hsc.level-1.png

IMPORTANT: plantUML also has the option `-nometadata` => it could be that your diagrams do not contain the metadata...
